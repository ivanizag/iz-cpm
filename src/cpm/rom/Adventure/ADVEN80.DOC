FILE: ADVEN80.DOC -- notes on the ADVEN80 Adventure Game System Programs
                  -- Bill Soon, Nov. 1981

These are notes regarding the three associated files:
	ADVEN80.MAC
	MAKEADV.BAS
	SAMPADV.ADV

ADVEN80.MAC is the source for the main adventure program, as published
in Dr. Dobbs Journal, Nov. 1981.  Changes were made, mostly to labels
which the Mac-80 Relocating Macro Assembler interpreted as reserved words.

MAKEADV.BAS is the Basic source for the 'macro' database/file processor.
This takes as input a file with the extension .ADV and produces an output
file with extension .MAC, converting the tables into Z80 assembler code
in the process.  A DSEG and a .Z80 pseudo-op is added to the beginning
of the .MAC file to ease the assembly and linking process.

SAMPADV.ADV is a small test adventure, generally close to the example
given in the DDJ article. This describes the environment in a more
readable and easy to enter form than trying to do it in straight Z80
mnemonics.

First, assemble ADVEN80.MAC using a relocating Z80 assembler. Microsoft
M80 / Mac-80 works.  Then run MAKEADV.BAS using Microsoft Basic interpreter
or optionally compile first using the Basic compiler. A file named
SAMPADV.MAC will be produced as output.  Assemble SAMPADV.MAC with
the relo. Z80 assembler. Using L80 or Digital Research's LINK-80
linking loader, link ADVEN80.REL with SAMPADV.REL and save on disk
to the FILENAME.COM of your choice.  Then run and enjoy.

Development System', by Peter D. Scargill, from Dr. Dobb's
Journal, #61, November 1981.

				*********

Adven-80 is a program wherein the user resides in one of many LOCATIONS.
A LOCATION may have the property of being LIGHT or DARK, and usually is
associated with several alternative EXITS.  The player moves from one
LOCATION to another; in any LOCATION he may find an OBJECT or OBJECTS.
Objects have DESCRIPTIONS, and may optionally have DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS
as well.  Unless specifically mentioned an object may be TAKEN or
DROPPED or LOOKED AT or otherwise manipulated within the confines of the
facilities of the MATCHW table.  Each object may only be in one location
at any given time (or may be worn or carried as applicable).  The object
of the game is usually to obtain some form of TREASURE or achieve a
SCORE of so many points.

Of special interest is the LINE PARSER, which examines a line of user
entry and checks each word in turn to see if it is a known word.  If so,
a token entry is make in a separate buffer.  The token buffer is scanned
for words such as "THEN" and "AND" -- if found, the line is split.  This
allows the use of multiple statement lines.

This Adventure system, written for the Z80 microprocessor, is a full-
feature, machine code Adventure which runs at very high speed, with a
minimum memory requirement (a simple Adventure could be written in well
under 16K).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tables:

OBJLOC  The format of this table, containing <object no./location> pairs
is simple.  The pairs are contiguous with a zero to end the table.
Several location numbers have special meanings and are listed below:

	Loc. 255	Object is non-existent. Cannot be found.
	Loc. 254	Object is currently being carried.
	Loc. 253	Object is currently being worn.

Location 252 is special in that any object currently in this location
is one of a pair of objects which together form a TWIN-STATE object.
Example: LAMP. The lamp may be LIT or UNLIT and so we need to have
two versions of the same object.

In the table, these two forms should always be concurrent.  In the
lamp example, the two states could be, say, LAMP and ULAMP. If the
word LAMP is made accessible, then this must appear FIRST in the
table.  This is very important. Example coding:

	OBJLOC	/* Table name. These are mandatory */

	LAMP 45  /* object 34, a lit lamp, is in locatin 45 */
	ULAMP 252 /* object 35, an unlit lamp, is hidden from view */

	ENDTABLE  /* end of table */

If the scanner begins at the start of the table, and then finds a
match with object LAMP, in order to blow out the lamp, the two
LOCATION entries in the table are simply swapped over.

Object ULAMP was equated only and *must never be* found by the
user-input encoding section, although CONDITION entries such
as OC or OP can access both versions.

If a user says GET LAMP, and there are no conditions, the system
will look for lamp.  If this is at location 252 then the pointer
will be incremented automatically to point at the ULAMP entry.
Hence the user will be given whichever version of the object is
NOT at location 252.  (Assuming that the other version is PRESENT
or being carried or whatever).

Inventories simply look at the location numbers and if a match is
found, then a description is printed. The same applies during the
initial description, where objects contained within the current
location are described.

---------------------------------------------------------------

OBJDES   This table containing <object no./MSG no.> pairs is
closely related to the above OBJLOC table.  During "I can see..."
type routines, the table OBJLOC is scanned in order to find
objects contained within a given location, be it the current
location or those reserved for objects being carried or worn.

When the object is found, the number of the object is used to scan
through the left side of OBJDES, and when an object match is found,
the description number, which refers to an entry in the UMESS
table, is used to produce a description of the required object.
The OBJDES table need be in no particular order, and no ZERO
terminator is required as we are not searching for a non-existent
object.  In the sample database the ENDTABLE macro is shown, but
this is just for neatness, it is not essential here.

---------------------------------------------------------------

OBPROP  This table describes the things that can be done to an object,
assuming you wish to limit that object to certain actions.  I.e, you
would not expect the player to TAKE THE STATUE if it weighs a ton...

	OBPROP
	STATUE	LOOK,LISTEN,FEEL
	DOOR	LOCK,UNLOCK,LOOK
	ENDTABLE

Objects not in the table are considered to have universal attributes
(within the limitations of the MATCHW table.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJDSK  This table finds use for those objects you would like to enable
a close inspection of.  Any object not appearing in this table will be
described as 'ordinary looking'.

	OBJDSK
	LAMP	'Looks like an old miner`s lamp to me.'
	ENDTABLE

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TABKEY  This table is used by the line parser. As the user input line
is parsed, 4-byte word sections are put into a temporary buffer. (Words
shorter than 4 characters long are left-justified and padded with
spaces).  TABKEY is used to replace any known words with a single byte
code.  Unknown words are scrapped.

Tabkey is composed of the following:  The first byte is the KEY number.
Following that are groups of 4 bytes, with the LAST 4-byte group
having the 8th BIT SET ON in the LAST CHARACTER.  If any of the 4-byte
groups match that in the buffer, then the KEY byte is put into a buffer
for later use.  To signify the end of the table, ZERO is used as a KEY
byte.

When the sentence has been completely scanned, a buffer called CODBUF
will contain the single byte KEY replacements to all the words in the
user input that matched.  A ZERO will indicate the end of this buffer.
Hence the sequence N "N NORT" will allow inputs of "N" or "GO NORTH"
to be placed in CODBUF as the single byte representing the key N.

A special byte which may end up in CODBUF is THEN. This is currently
set at 250 decimal and is used for batching of commands, so that the
user may say, for example, "GET THE AXE THEN LOOK AT IT.  The IT
is taken care of automatically by a section of code that converts
occurences of IT into the last mentioned object.

Keysets for TABKEY are actually entered in macro form; i.e.:

	BEGIN	'BEGISTAR'

Another example is: LOOK "LOOKPERUEXAM" where LOOK is the word
equated to a KEY number, and will match on LOOK, PERUSE,
and EXAMINE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

MATCHW  This table looks at user input after it has been encoded
into a byte sequence.  The table is scanned until a pair of bytes
corresponding to those in the CODBUF area are found.  If there
is no match then a default message is printed to indicate that the
program found no sensible matches.  Otherwise, a set of CONDITIONS
is checked, and if all of these are TRUE, then a set of actions
is taken. The format is as follows:

  <2 byte key><cond><255><actions><255><either ZERO or more ceys>

  where cond = either no entry or any amount of conditions
  and arguments, and actions = any amount of actions.

255 is a delimiter and so must not occur within either the
conditions or the actions.  However, 255 may be used as one of
the twg KEY bytes to tell the program to match up with ANY entry:

  <23,255>  If CODBUF contains 23 followed by anything, then
	    the set will be accepted.

  <34,0>    In this case, CODBUF should contain 34 ONLY.

Again, simple equates are used to make life easy:

	MATCH	GET,ANY
	TEST	OH,INP
	ACTION	TKE,INP,OK

In the above example, if the user enters, say, GET LAMP, then
the system will test to see if the object is in the current
location (OH) and if so, will allow the taking of the LAMP and
will then print an OK message and exit the table, ready for
more user input.

	MATCH	LOOK,NULL
	ACTION	LA,EXTB

If and only if the user enters the single word LOOK, the system
will unconditionally Look Around, then EXit the TaBle.

	MATCH	ANY,ANY
	ACTION	PRM,37,EXTB

This entry should be put at the end of the MATCHW table.  This
will match ANY user input, and print message 37 from the MSG
table, which would be, for example, "I don`t know what you mean."

	MATCH	ON,LAMP
	TEST	OC,MATCH,OC,ULAMP
	ACTION	SWP,LAMP,SWP,MATCH,OK

This is a more complex example.  If the user enters ON LAMP or
LIGHT THE LAMP, etc., and then only if the MATCH and the ULAMP
(unlit lamp) are being carried, then swap the MATCH for its USED
partner, and swap the ULAMP with its LIT partner.

Notice no attempt was made to execute the instruction SWP,ULAMP.
This would be disastrous as the ULAMP is the SECOND entry in the
table (of the twin-state pair LAMP/ULAMP), and you must only
SWAP the FIRST entry (the main entry), as the command SWP,FRED
looks for the entry FRED in the OBJLOC table, and swaps its
location with that of the *next* entry in the table. That is why
the user-accessible version of the object *must* be entered
into the table before the alternative form.

------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------
Messages:

MSG  This is a general purpose message table, containing messages such as
"I can not see anything" and "OK".  These messages include directives and
all general statements. The format is extremely simple:

	0  message sequefce  0  message sequence  0

The sequence is that of a zero byte followed by ASCII text until the
next zero. The zero then acts as both delimiter and counter.  As the
maximum message number is known (there is no search), an end-of-table
delimiter is not required, other than the zero at the end of message.

NOTE that the first 20 messages must *not* be altered in position as they
are used by the system in some cases automatically.  There is a limit
of 255 messages.  In macro form, simply enter the message number and
the message:

	45  'Hi there, this is a message, isn`t it..%'

Note that the standard apostrophe (') cannot be used *within text* and
must be replaced by the reverse apostrophe (`)/  The (%) percent sign
is used as a CRLF and cannot be used for its original purpose.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

UMESS  This table contains descriptions of objects and all general
messages that are specific to a particular adventure.

	7  'This is another message'

Note:  CRL will be sent to the screen upon encountering a % sign in
the text.  Also, the character '>' anywhere in a sentence will not
produce any output, but will cancel any pending batching of commands.

It is possible to have conditional sections within messages (or indeed
complete conditional messages).  Flags 23 to 49 inclusive have been
reserved for this purpose.  These may be tested for TRUE or FALSE only,
in the following manner.  Anywhere within a string, the game writer may
insert braces as follows:

  'This is a bit of {Auntidy } test{B as you can{C easily} see}.'

If flags 23 (i.e., A), 24 (B), and 25 (C), are all ZERO then the output
of the message would be "This is a bit of text."; but if one were to
set flag 25 the the output would be "This is a bit of untidy text."

If flag 24 was set, then: "This is a bit of text as you can see."
If flag 25 were also set, the word "easily" would be inserted. Note,
however, that this would not apply if flag 24 were 0, then all text
inside the matching set of braces would be ignored.

Only the letters A-Z inclusive and the "/" character may be used
after the opening braces (A-Z corresponding to flags 24-49)
and the maximum nesting depth is 10, although as many non-nested
sets as desired may be put into any section of text.  The character "/"
may be used *before* any of the alpha chars A-Z to indicate that the
flag has *not* been set, i.e, is ZERO.  The system flag that
indicates that the "/" char is in use is only set and reset on
OPENING braces so don't try any fancy multi-level conditional text
while using this form.

In this version, two special flags have been reserved.  Flags 21
and 22 corresponding to @ and ? are automatically set by the program
after every user entry to be always opposite but randomly so. If
flag 21 = 1 then flag 22 will = 0, and vice-versa.  Hence it is
possible to write the following default message:

	44  '{@I simply don`t understand you.}{?What?}'

Whenever this message is called, there is a 50-50 chance of either
"What?" or "I simply don`t understand you." being output by the
program.

These conditional facilities may be used anywhere that text is found,
either in place descriptions, object descriptions, or even default
replies.  A good use is to allow for either random or deliberate
variations in, say, the default "Can`t help you" message, etc. etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Descriptions:

LOC   Place descriptions begin with zero, a number 255 to 252 to
indicate one of the following:

	255	Normal place, full exit description
	254	Normal place, no exit description printed
	253	Dark place, full exit description (if lit by lamp)
	252	Dark place, no exit description printed

In high level form the following words have the same effect:

	NORMAL	= 255
	NOEXIT	= 254
	DARK	= 253
	DARKNO	= 252

then followed by MESSAGE  KEY  LOCATION bytes, 255 to indicate end of
directions, and then textual description with zero being the text
terminator. Example:

	0 254 02 01 02 255 <text> 0 253 03 32 12 255 <text> 0

In macro form, a typical entry:

	1	NOEXIT,2,N,2
	   'I am in a small room with no furniture. There '
	   'appears to be nobody around at the moment.%'


This means location #1 is a normal place printing no exit description,
description of North from MSG 2, match on user KEY of 'N', and transfer
player to location #2 if a match is found.

Again, no end of table required other than the mandatory zero,
(or ENDTABLE) as we are not looking for locations which do not
exist.

A special location number is 249 (RTN).  When a transfer is made to this
location, the program will treat this in a special manner by returning
the user to the previous location.  Hence, you may enter a LARGE BOX
and an RTN exit will get you out, no matter where the box is situated.
This eliminates much location testing.
