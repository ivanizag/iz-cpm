# iz-cpm -- CP/M 2.2 environment

## What is this?

This is a CP/M 2.2 execution environment. It provides everything needed to run a standard CP/M for Z80 or 8080 binary.

Uses my [iz80](https://github.com/ivanizag/iz80) library for Zilog Z80 and Intel 8080 emulation.

Made with Rust

Note that iz-cpm is a very basic implementation, mostly for educational purposes. I recommend MockbaTheBorg's [RunCPM](https://github.com/MockbaTheBorg/RunCPM) or Udo Munk's [Z80pack](https://github.com/udo-munk/z80pack/blob/master/doc/README-cpm.txt) for a much more complete CP/M emulation. 

## Installation
Extract the [latest zip](https://github.com/ivanizag/iz-cpm/releases) for Linux, MacOS or Windows. Optionally run `download.sh` or `download.bat`  to download the CP/M 2.2 system disk, Microsoft Basic, Turbo Pascal, Lisp and some games.

## Build from source
To build from source, install the latest Rust compiler, clone the repo and run `cargo rust --release`. To cross compile to Windows, install the target with `rustup` and run `cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.

## Usage examples

Execute `iz-cpm` to open the CP/M command prompt (the CCP) on the current directory:
```console
casa@servidor:~/software/cpm22$ ls
ASM.COM      CCSINIT.COM   DISKDEF.LIB  iz-cpm        STAT.COM
CBIOS.ASM    CCSYSGEN.COM  DUMP.ASM     LOAD.COM      STDBIOS.ASM
CCBIOS.ASM   CPM24CCS.COM  DUMP.COM     MOVCPM.COM    SUBMIT.COM
CCBOOT.ASM   DDT.COM       ED.COM       PIP.COM       SYSGEN.COM
-CCSCPM.251  DEBLOCK.ASM   GENMOD.COM   RLOCBIOS.COM

```

Execute `iz-cpm` with a file to execute a CP/M binary directly, bypassing the CPP:
```console
casa@servidor:~$ ./iz-cpm software/OBASIC.COM 
44531 Bytes free
BASIC Rev. 4.51
[CP/M Version]
Copyright 1977 (C) by Microsoft
Ok
print "hello"
hello
Ok

```

Map up to 16 directories as CP/M drives:
```console
casa@servidor:~$ ./iz-cpm --disk-a software/cpm22 --disk-b software/zork --disk-e .

## Features

- Execution of 8080 and Z80 binaries on top of CP/M
- Direct usage of the host computer filesystem
- Terminal emulation of ADM-3A as used in the KAYPRO computers
- Z80 emulation validated with ZEXALL
- CPU execution tracing
- BDOS and BIOS tracing
- Portable, runs in Linux, MacOS and Windows. Mmm, not in CP/M.

## How does it work

[CP/M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M) was designed to be portable to a variety of devices using Intel 8080, Intel 8085 or Zilog Z80 processors thanks to a tiered architecture. The main parts of CP/M are:

- The BIOS: Basic Input/Output system. Interface with the hardware. CP/M defines a very small interface: 16 entrypoints to manage I/O and access to disk sectors. The hardware vendors provided the BIOS for their device based on source code available on the CP/M distribution.
- The BDOS: Basic Disk Operating System. Main component of CP/M. Provided by Digital Research and common to all systems. Provides the high level entrypoints to be used by application developpers.
- The CCP: Console Command Processor. The CP/M Command prompt.

To emulate this environment using the host filesystem, we have to provide a replacement BDOS translating as we don't want to relay on the physical disk sectors abstraction of the BIOS. The main components are:

- Z80 emulator. It uses [iz80](https://github.com/ivanizag/iz80)
- [BIOS](src/bios.rs) emulator. Only the I/O entrypoints. In theory, it shouldn't be necessary, but some programs use it directly, bypassing BDOS.
- [BDOS](src/bdos.rs) emulator. Traps the calls and executes code on the  host.
- CPP. Runs natively, no emulation needed. We use ZCPR1 an open source alternative. See [cpmish](http://cowlark.com/cpmish/) for other open source alternatives to the CP/M binaries. The CPP binary from CP/M 2.2 can be used optionally.
- [Terminal](src/terminal.rs) emulator. CP/M does not define how the terminal should work. Applications needed to be aware and usually could be configured for several leading options, like ADM-3a, VT-52, Hazeltine 1500 and Osborne. This emulator supports ADM-3a used also on the very popular Kaypro computers.

## TODO
- Proper documentation
- File level read-only option (I won't do that, the host can control that)
- BIOS support for punch cards (Nope)
- BIOS support for track/sector access to disks (Not needed)
