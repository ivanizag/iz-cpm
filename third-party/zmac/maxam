Notes on MAXAM compatibility
============================

MAXAM is an assembler for Amstrad CPC machines
(a CP/M version also exists).

zmac tries to be MAXAM-compatible.

Note the following major differences with MAXAM 1.14, though:

- zmac allows ' and " strings to be specified using '''' and """".
MAXAM only allows '"' and "'", which zmac also allows.

- zmac will truncate symbols to 40 characters.
MAXAM has no such restriction.

- MAXAM allows strings to be terminated by end-of-line.
zmac does not.

- When using the READ directive, MAXAM will take the first
non-whitespace character as the filename delimiter.  zmac only
allows ' or " as a filename delimiter.

- AMSDOS restrictions prevent MAXAM from supporting nested
READs, which zmac allows.  AMSDOS restrictions also prevent
MAXAM from supporting directories.

- zmac has a pretty decent expression parser.
MAXAM does not (no parentheses, no precedence).

- zmac handles multiple ORGs by inserting padding bytes in
the .bin file, but of course this means retrograde ORGs are
not possible.

- MAXAM allows multiple statements on the same line, separated
by colons.  zmac does not.

- zmac has many synonyms for operators, directives, labels, hex
constants, etc., which MAXAM does not support.  The easiest
thing is not to find out about them!
