* Changes between versions   -*- mode:indented-text; mode:outline-minor -*-

This file (NEWS) documents the significant changes between all
versions of zmac (since version 1.0), with the newest changes first.

* Changes in zmac 1.4

- Correct a bug in symbol table loading

- Add VC6-Win32 project

* Changes in zmac 1.3

- Allow ':label' and 'label', and '$' and '#' for hex constants.

- Add relationals.

- Add more synonyms.

- Fix logical operator bugs.

- Fix error handling.

- Make operator precedence C-like.

- Allow normal parentheses in expressions.

- Revamp man page and add plain text version.


* Changes in zmac 1.2

- Make filename handling more portable.

- Introduce -x and new -o options (old -o is now '-x -').

- Improve ANSI C-ness.

- Add support for writing out files with AMSDOS headers.

- Add support for RISC OS throwback.


* Changes in zmac 1.1.1.2

- Fix nested ELSE bug.

- Pad .bin file when multiple ORGs used.

- Add optimisation suggester.

- Tweak list of valid 8080 opcodes.


* Changes in zmac 1.1.1.1

- Add ELSE, READ, DB, DS, DW, DEFM, TEXT and RMEM directives.

- Allow & to introduce a hex constant, " as a string delimiter
and . to introduce labels.

- Allow AND, OR and XOR to be used as binary operators.

- Warn for truncated symbols and non-standard syntax.


* Changes in zmac 1.1

- Fixed the nasty assumption that filenames were never more than 14
  chars (which was *never* valid, as filenames can include the path to
  the file).

- Error reports now conform to the canonical format for compilers and
  the like (as the GNU coding standards put it,
  "SOURCE-FILE-NAME:LINENO: MESSAGE"). This is a lot more sensible
  than the previous OVERALL-LINENO: MESSAGE\nERROR-LINE\n (and means
  you can easily jump to errors when using Emacs' `M-x compile'), but
  you can get SOURCE-FILE-NAME:LINENO: MESSAGE\nERROR-LINE\n if you
  use the `-S' option.

- Now supports GNU-ish `--help' and `--version' options.
